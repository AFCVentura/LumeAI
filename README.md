## What is Lume
Lume is a mobile movie recommendation app project. The application was built using .NET MAUI, the server with ASP.NET Core, the database with MySQL, and the AI ​​with ML.NET.

The app recommends movies based on user responses about their current movie preferences. The movies are pre-grouped into clusters in the database, and filters are applied to the clusters closest to the user's preferences to select a few movies that fit their desires.
